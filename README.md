## Created to make time for study
Ok, Let's face it, I love to learn about programming stuff so much that i might fail my next high school exam. Time to end this habit.

A simple python script which automatically shutdowns my computer if i start it bitween 6pm to 10pm until my exam (April) 


#Usage:
	clone this repo.
	replace your password in shutdown.py
	chmod +x shutdown.py
	then start a new crontab typing `crontab -e' 
	and add this lines '@reboot /home/user/path/shutdown.py'


Happy examming xD
